        "# Statistical Analysis for a Chatbot\n",
        "1. Background\n",
        "\n",
        "  Nowadays, high blood pressure has been very common among elderlies. According to WHO, an estimated 1.28 billion adults aged 30-79 years worldwide are experiencing hypertension especially those living in low- and middle-income countries. In United Stated, nearly half of adults have hypertension(48.1%, 119.9 million) from Centers for Diease Control and Prevention.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Those statistics tell us that hypertension is very prevalant worldwide. The model is for telling audiences about the general information such as what is hypertension and what I can do after I am dignosed with hypertension. The interactive and human-like chatbot can provide users with comfortable and caring environment of getting the information about hypertension.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "  The project is divided into two parts, the chat bot and the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  The chatbot is a generative model. All the sources are based on the public website about hypertension online. The model is supposed to score the similarity between the questions asked by the users and sentences and then choose the sentences with the sentences of highest similarity scores.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The statistical analysis is to firstly find the similarity score between the answers provided by doctors and answers generated by the chatbot and then visualize the results to reach the statistical conclusion.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The chatbot is gained from a `YouTube video`[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KZwRBg4-P0&list=PL5eb-nnjclfTjxHXrUeTD1roACSmnC4CM] and the statistical analysis is original."

            "What is blood pressure? Blood pressure is a measure of the pressure or force of blood against the walls of your blood vessels (arteries). Your blood pressure reading is based on two measures. The top number (systolic) is the measure of the pressure when your heart contracts and pushes blood through the arteries. The bottom (diastolic) number is the measure of the pressure when your heart relaxes between beats. There are three different blood pressure categories: low risk, medium risk, high risk. See your doctor or healthcare provider to get a proper blood pressure measurement and find out which category you are in. Blood pressure categories Category Systolic/Diastolic Low risk 120 / 80 Medium risk 121-134 / 80-84 High risk 135+ /85+ There are some exceptions to these categories. If you have diabetes, the high risk category for your blood pressure is slightly lower. Your blood pressure should be less than 130 / 80. Consult a healthcare provider if your blood pressure level is higher than 130 / 80 on more than one occasion.\n",
            "\n",
            "What is low blood pressure? Low blood pressure (hypotension) is when the pressure in your arteries drops below the normal range. But blood pressure levels below 120 / 80 may be normal for some people. Your healthcare provider will tell you if you have low blood pressure.\n",

After 65, women are more likely than men to get high blood pressure.

            "You can’t see high blood pressure, also called hypertension. And most of the time, you can’t feel it. But if you’re among the 78 million Americans with hypertension or are one of the 70 million with prehypertension (higher-than-healthy blood pressure levels), it’s important to understand its effects on your health—and to take action today to bring your numbers down to healthier levels. Blood pressure is the force of blood against the inner walls of your arteries. It has normal fluctuations throughout the day—falling when you’re relaxed or asleep, rising naturally in the morning, and increasing temporarily when you’re under stress, excited or exercising. But when your resting blood pressure level rises too high, it can scar, stiffen and/or weaken blood vessels. This effect can double your risk for a heart attack ; quadruple your odds for a stroke ; raise your risk for heart failure , vision loss, kidney problems, dementia and circulation problems such as peripheral artery disease (which causes pain in your legs); weaken your bones ; and contribute to erectile dysfunction in men.\n",
            "\n",
            "Causes and Risk Factors You may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure if you smoke, are overweight, eat a diet that’s low on produce and fiber and/or high in fat and salt, drink alcohol to excess, live with chronic stress or don’t get much physical activity. Some causes of hypertension cannot be controlled—including your genes and your race (African-Americans are at a higher risk). Aging also plays a role. Even if you do not have hypertension by age 55 to 65, your lifetime risk for developing it is a whopping 90 percent. “But doctors no longer consider hypertension inevitable or untreatable with age,” says Samuel Durso, M.D., director of the Division of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology at Johns Hopkins. In one Johns Hopkins study of 975 older women and men with hypertension, healthy lifestyle steps helped 40 percent stop taking blood pressure medications. Other research has shown that lifestyle changes can lower the risk for hypertension in African-Americans and others at an increased genetic risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "Prevention A healthy lifestyle is a strong shield against high blood pressure and its damaging effects. These steps can lower your risk—and also help lower your numbers if you already have prehypertension or hypertension. Lose a little weight. Excess weight—and especially excess fat stored in your abdomen—can raise blood pressure by increasing your blood volume and by changing the balance of pressure-regulating hormones. “Even modest weight loss can make a world of difference,” Durso notes, pointing to research that shows that losing just 7.7 pounds could reduce your risk for high blood pressure by 50 percent or more. Cut back on alcohol. “Moderating alcohol is very important,” Durso says. “If you are a man who has more than two drinks a day or a woman who has more than one drink a day, cut back.” While a little alcohol may relax arteries, too much seems to have the opposite effect. Move more. Exercise and other kinds of physical activity help keep arteries flexible and also reduce activity in the sympathetic nervous system , which can tighten blood vessels and boost blood pressure. If you already have high blood pressure, regular exercise alone could lower your numbers by 8 to 10 points, according to the American Heart Association. Feed healthy blood pressure. The minerals calcium, magnesium and potassium (found in low-fat and fat-free dairy products, such as milk and yogurt, as well as in produce and dried beans) help your body regulate blood pressure. Too little can raise your blood pressure. So can high amounts of sodium—found in many processed foods—by making your body retain water (which boosts blood volume) and even tightening small blood vessels. Saturated fat (found in meat, cheese, butter, full-fat dairy products and many processed foods) may also raise blood pressure. Quit smoking. Smoking damages arteries and raises the risk of heart disease. While you’re having a cigarette, the chemicals in tobacco products elevate blood pressure too. Soothe stress. It’s not clear whether mind-body therapies have a lasting effect on blood pressure or reduce the risk, but it is known that the body’s stress response releases hormones that temporarily raise blood pressure. You’ll feel better, and find it easier to make other healthy changes, if you regularly practice a stress-soothing technique such as breathing exercises, progressive relaxation and fitness activities. One technique, meditation, has been shown to reduce the risk for heart attacks and strokes in people with high blood pressure.\n",
            "\n",
            "Diagnosis & Treatment To bring your high blood pressure down to a healthy level, your doctor will likely recommend healthy lifestyle changes, medication or both. “The decision to begin blood pressure medication—and the amount and type your doctor prescribes—will depend on the severity of your high blood pressure,” Durso explains. “If you have prehypertension or if your blood pressure is mildly elevated, lifestyle changes alone may be the first step. Losing 5 percent to 10 percent of your body weight, reducing sodium, improving your diet and exercising regularly will usually result in a lowering of your blood pressure. If your blood pressure is higher, your doctor will still recommend these changes along with blood pressure medications.” There are six major types of blood pressure medications: Diuretics work by helping the body eliminate extra water and sodium.\n",

            "work by helping the body eliminate extra water and sodium. Beta blockers reduce your heart rate and output of blood, which lowers blood pressure.\n",

            "reduce your heart rate and output of blood, which lowers blood pressure. Vasodilators, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium-channel blockers all work by relaxing constricted blood vessels. “Your doctor will choose the medications that are right for you,” Durso says. “Often, doctors prescribe more than one medication to control blood pressure. You may need medications that work on several different mechanisms to bring your blood pressure down. Or your doctor may be able to give you lower medication doses, and reduce the chances for side effects, by combining two or three medications.” Two important things to know about your treatment: Your doctor may increase your dose gradually. “It may take a month to six weeks to bring your blood pressure down by slowly raising your medication doses,” Durso notes. “Lowering blood pressure too quickly can cause dizziness and increase the risk for falls.” Report side effects. “Don’t stop medications on your own,” warns Durso. “Call or make an appointment to tell your doctor about side effects you may be having. He or she may be able to make adjustments or switch your medication.” Side effects can include tiredness, cold hands or feet, impotence, depression, sleep problems, heartbeat changes and a dry cough.

            "Living With High blood pressure often has no symptoms. That can make staying on track with healthy lifestyle changes and medication challenging—you may not feel the difference. These steps can help you stay committed to controlling your blood pressure on a day-to-day basis: Use a medication reminder system. A daily pill dispenser, electronic pill bottles that beep when it’s time for your next dose, a note on your refrigerator—use whichever reminder system works best for you. About one in two people with hypertension don’t take their drugs as directed, a mistake that can raise your risk for heart disease, stroke and other health problems. Monitor at home. “You are the most important member of your blood pressure control team. A home blood pressure monitor will help you see if your medications and lifestyle changes are helping, and can help you stay on track,” Durso says. “You can find inexpensive monitors at the pharmacy.” See your doctor as recommended. “Your doctor may want to see you every three to four months for the first few years after your diagnosis, to be sure your medications and lifestyle changes are working and to make adjustments,” Durso says. “For someone whose high blood pressure is well-managed and who monitors at home, a checkup every six months may be sufficient. If your blood pressure is within a healthy range and you do not need medication, you may only need a recheck every two years.” Watch for lows and highs. Sometimes blood pressure medications can reduce your blood pressure too much. If you have signs of low blood pressure—dizziness, fainting, blurred vision, nausea—contact your doctor. On the other hand, if your systolic (top) number rises to 180 or higher or if your diastolic (bottom) number rises to 110 or higher, get immediate medical help.\n",

Cheerleading a new habit can inspire your loved one to stick with it. But trying to control behavior can backfire. If your loved one isn’t making healthy changes, ask how you can help. Get healthier together. Spouses who commit to weight loss and exercise together may be more likely to stick with their efforts. Upgrading your habits together can be inspiring, engenders a little healthy competition, and is more convenient too, because you can both eat the same foods and set the same exercise schedule.\n",

            "Definitions Blood vessels (veh-suls): The system of flexible tubes—arteries, capillaries and veins—that carries blood through the body. Oxygen and nutrients are delivered by arteries to tiny, thin-walled capillaries that feed them to cells and pick up waste material, including carbon dioxide. Capillaries pass the waste to veins, which take the blood back to the heart and lungs, where carbon dioxide is let out through your breath as you exhale. Dementia (di-men-sha): A loss of brain function that can be caused by a variety of disorders affecting the brain. Symptoms include forgetfulness, impaired thinking and judgment, personality changes, agitation and loss of emotional control. Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease and inadequate blood flow to the brain can all cause dementia. Most types of dementia are irreversible. Diastolic (die-uh-stah-lick) blood pressure: The second, or bottom, number in a blood pressure reading. Diastolic blood pressure measures the force of blood in the arteries when the heart is relaxed between beats. A healthy reading is usually below 80 mm Hg. Higher readings may indicate that you have high blood pressure or are at risk for developing it. Heart failure: When the heart cannot supply as much blood as the body needs, because it cannot fill completely or cannot pump with enough force. Diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and heart valve problems can cause heart failure. Heart failure does not mean the heart is about to stop. Medications and lifestyle changes can reduce symptoms. Peripheral artery disease (puh-rif-er-uhl ahr-tah-ree dih-zeez): A build-up of fat and cholesterol deposits called plaque in arteries in your legs, arms, head or internal organs. This reduces blood flow, causing pain, numbness and a heavy, aching sensation when walking or climbing stairs. Peripheral artery disease can increase the risk for slow-healing infections, too. Treatments include quitting smoking and controlling blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar. Saturated fat: A type of fat found in abundance in butter, whole milk, ice cream, full-fat cheese, fatty meats, poultry skin, and palm and coconut oils. Saturated fat raises levels of heart-threatening LDL cholesterol in your bloodstream. It can also interfere with your body’s ability to absorb blood sugar easily. Limiting saturated fat can help control your risk for heart disease. Sympathetic nervous system: The system that produces the “fight or flight” response and prepares you for stress or an emergency. It’s responsible for readying the body for action: increasing the heart rate, breathing rate and alertness. The body’s parasympathetic nervous system does the opposite. It slows heart and breathing rate, bringing on a sense of relaxation. Systolic (sis-tall-ick) blood pressure: The top, or first, number in a blood pressure reading. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during a heartbeat. For most people, a healthy systolic blood pressure reading is below 120 mm Hg. Rising systolic blood pressure may indicate that arteries are becoming stiff or that there’s a build-up of plaque.About high blood pressure High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is usually defined as having a sustained blood pressure of 140/90mmHg or above. The line between normal and raised blood pressure is not fixed and depends on your individual circumstances. However, most doctors agree that the ideal blood pressure for a physically healthy person is around 120/80mmHg. A normal blood pressure reading is classed as less than 130/80mmHg. The heart (blood pump) The heart is a muscle that is designed to constantly pump blood around the body. It pumps blood that is low in oxygen towards the lungs, through the venous ‘pipeline’ (veins), where it receives a fresh supply of oxygen. Once the blood is fully oxygenated, the heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood around the body so that the oxygen can be used by the body’s muscles and cells, through the arterial ‘pipeline’ (arteries). How is blood pressure measured? Blood pressure is defined as the amount of pressure that is exerted on the artery walls as blood moves through them. It is measured in millimetres of mercury, or mmHg. A more detailed explanation is provided below. Two measurements are used to measure blood pressure: Systolic pressure – the measure of blood pressure exerted when your heart beats and forces blood around your body.\n",
            "\n",
            "Diastolic pressure – the measure of blood pressure when your heart is resting in between beats. Both the systolic and diastolic pressures are measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg). The figures are usually represented with the systolic pressure first, followed by the diastolic pressure. Therefore, if your GP says that your blood pressure is ‘120 over 80’, or 120/80mmHg, they mean that you have a systolic pressure of 120mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 80mmHg. More about the diagnosis of high blood pressure Symptoms of high blood pressure High blood pressure often causes no symptoms, or immediate problems. The only way to find out whether you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure checked regularly. Ask your GP when you are next due for yours to be checked.

High blood pressure is a common condition, it is estimated that 18% of adult men and 13% of adult women have high blood pressure but are not getting treatment for it. In 90-95% of cases, there is no single identifiable reason for a rise in blood pressure. But all available evidence shows that lifestyle plays a significant role in regulating your blood pressure. Risk factors for high blood pressure include: age (the risk of developing high blood pressure increases with age. Half of people over 75 years have the condition.)\n",

Regular blood pressure checks for over over 40’s The only way to find out whether you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure checked regularly. Ask your GP when you are next due for yours to be checked. Blood pressure checks are usually available on request at most GP surgeries and health clinics. Some surgeries have home monitoring devices available, which you may be able to use at the time of blood pressure medication start up or change. Many also have a policy of arranging regular checks for you. Adults who are over 40 and have not been diagnosed with high blood pressure should have their blood pressure checked at least once every five years. However, your blood pressure should ideally be checked more frequently, particularly if you have any contributory risk factors. Regular blood pressure checks if diagnosed with high blood pressure If you are diagnosed with high blood pressure, your blood pressure will need to be closely monitored until it is brought under control. After your blood pressure has been controlled, your GP or practice nurse will measure your blood pressure at agreed regular intervals (at least once a year). It is important you attend these appointments to ensure your blood pressure is being maintained within an acceptable range. Blood pressure checks during pregnancy If you are pregnant, you should have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis, even if it is not high. Watching your blood pressure while you are pregnant reduces your risk of developing pregnancy-induced hypertension.

Ask your GP when you are next due for yours to be checked. Before having your blood pressure taken, you should rest for at least five minutes and empty your bladder. To get an accurate blood pressure reading, you should be sitting down and not talking when the reading is taken. Having one high blood pressure reading does not necessarily mean that you have high blood pressure. Your blood pressure can change throughout the day. Feeling anxious or stressed when you visit your GP can raise your blood pressure (often referred to as ‘white coat syndrome’). Therefore, your GP will need to take several readings over a set period of time, usually every month, to see whether your blood pressure level is consistently high. Blood and urine tests may also be carried out in order to check for conditions that are known to cause an increase in blood pressure, such as kidney infections. You may also be given a blood pressure device to take home so that you can record your blood pressure level throughout the day. This also helps to identify white coat syndrome and therefore helps to identify the best treatment options for you. Sphygmomanometer Blood pressure is traditionally measured using a device known as a sphygmomanometer. This device uses an inflatable cuff and has a scale of mercury, like a thermometer. Your pulse is heard by the health professional taking your blood pressure, through a stethoscope placed on your artery. Digital sphygmomanometer Many GP surgeries now use digital, or semi automatic, sphygmomanometers which measures your pulse using electrical sensors in a cuff that is usually placed around your upper arm. The cuff is pumped up to restrict the blood flow in your arm, before slowly being released. Digital blood pressure device Digital blood pressure devices are now commercially available. Blood pressure testing kits are also commercially available.\n",

Age\\n\\nReviewed By:\\n\\nYou can’t see high blood pressure, also called hypertension.', 'And most of the time, you can’t feel it.', 'But if you’re among the 78 million Americans with hypertension or are one of the 70 million with prehypertension (higher-than-healthy blood pressure levels), it’s important to understand its effects on your health—and to take action today to bring your numbers down to healthier levels.', 'Blood pressure is the force of blood against the inner walls of your arteries.', 'It has normal fluctuations throughout the day—falling when you’re relaxed or asleep, rising naturally in the morning, and increasing temporarily when you’re under stress, excited or exercising.', 'But when your resting blood pressure level rises too high, it can scar, stiffen and/or weaken blood vessels.', 'This effect can double your risk for a heart attack ; quadruple your odds for a stroke ; raise your risk for heart failure , vision loss, kidney problems, dementia and circulation problems such as peripheral artery disease (which causes pain in your legs); weaken your bones ; and contribute to erectile dysfunction in men.', 'Causes and Risk Factors You may be at an increased risk for high blood pressure if you smoke, are overweight, eat a diet that’s low on produce and fiber and/or high in fat and salt, drink alcohol to excess, live with chronic stress or don’t get much physical activity.', 'Some causes of hypertension cannot be controlled—including your genes and your race (African-Americans are at a higher risk).', 'Aging also plays a role.', 'Even if you do not have hypertension by age 55 to 65, your lifetime risk for developing it is a whopping 90 percent.', '“But doctors no longer consider hypertension inevitable or untreatable with age,” says Samuel Durso, M.D., director of the Division of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology at Johns Hopkins.', 'In one Johns Hopkins study of 975 older women and men with hypertension, healthy lifestyle steps helped 40 percent stop taking blood pressure medications.', 'Other research has shown that lifestyle changes can lower the risk for hypertension in African-Americans and others at an increased genetic risk.', 'Prevention A healthy lifestyle is a strong shield against high blood pressure and its damaging effects.', 'These steps can lower your risk—and also help lower your numbers if you already have prehypertension or hypertension.', 'Lose a little weight.', 'Excess weight—and especially excess fat stored in your abdomen—can raise blood pressure by increasing your blood volume and by changing the balance of pressure-regulating hormones.', '“Even modest weight loss can make a world of difference,” Durso notes, pointing to research that shows that losing just 7.7 pounds could reduce your risk for high blood pressure by 50 percent or more.', 'Cut back on alcohol.', '“Moderating alcohol is very important,” Durso says.', '“If you are a man who has more than two drinks a day or a woman who has more than one drink a day, cut back.” While a little alcohol may relax arteries, too much seems to have the opposite effect.', 'Move more.', 'Exercise and other kinds of physical activity help keep arteries flexible and also reduce activity in the sympathetic nervous system , which can tighten blood vessels and boost blood pressure.', 'If you already have high blood pressure, regular exercise alone could lower your numbers by 8 to 10 points, according to the American Heart Association.', 'Feed healthy blood pressure.', 'The minerals calcium, magnesium and potassium (found in low-fat and fat-free dairy products, such as milk and yogurt, as well as in produce and dried beans) help your body regulate blood pressure.', 'Too little can raise your blood pressure.', 'So can high amounts of sodium—found in many processed foods—by making your body retain water (which boosts blood volume) and even tightening small blood vessels.', 'Saturated fat (found in meat, cheese, butter, full-fat dairy products and many processed foods) may also raise blood pressure.', 'Quit smoking.', 'Smoking damages arteries and raises the risk of heart disease.', 'While you’re having a cigarette, the chemicals in tobacco products elevate blood pressure too.', 'Soothe stress.', 'It’s not clear whether mind-body therapies have a lasting effect on blood pressure or reduce the risk, but it is known that the body’s stress response releases hormones that temporarily raise blood pressure.', 'You’ll feel better, and find it easier to make other healthy changes, if you regularly practice a stress-soothing technique such as breathing exercises, progressive relaxation and fitness activities.', 'One technique, meditation, has been shown to reduce the risk for heart attacks and strokes in people with high blood pressure.', 'Diagnosis & Treatment To bring your high blood pressure down to a healthy level, your doctor will likely recommend healthy lifestyle changes, medication or both.', '“The decision to begin blood pressure medication—and the amount and type your doctor prescribes—will depend on the severity of your high blood pressure,” Durso explains.', '“If you have prehypertension or if your blood pressure is mildly elevated, lifestyle changes alone may be the first step.', 'Losing 5 percent to 10 percent of your body weight, reducing sodium, improving your diet and exercising regularly will usually result in a lowering of your blood pressure.', 'If your blood pressure is higher, your doctor will still recommend these changes along with blood pressure

medications that are right for you,” Durso says.', '“Often, doctors prescribe more than one medication to control blood pressure.', 'You may need medications that work on several different mechanisms to bring your blood pressure down.', 'Or your doctor may be able to give you lower medication doses, and reduce the chances for side effects, by combining two or three medications.” Two important things to know about your treatment: Your doctor may increase your dose gradually.', '“It may take a month to six weeks to bring your blood pressure down by slowly raising your medication doses,” Durso notes.', '“Lowering blood pressure too quickly can cause dizziness and increase the risk for falls.” Report side effects.', '“Don’t stop medications on your own,” warns Durso.', '“Call or make an appointment to tell your doctor about side effects you may be having.', 'He or she may be able to make adjustments or switch your medication.” Side effects can include tiredness, cold hands or feet, impotence, depression, sleep problems, heartbeat changes and a dry cough.', 'Learn more about the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in the Health Library.', 'Living With High

your medications and lifestyle changes are helping, and can help you stay on track,” Durso says.', '“You can find inexpensive monitors at the pharmacy.” See your doctor as recommended.', '“Your doctor may want to see you every three to four months for the first few years after your diagnosis, to be sure your medications and lifestyle changes are working and to make adjustments,” Durso says.', '“For someone whose high blood pressure is well-managed and who monitors at home, a checkup every six months may be sufficient.', 'If your blood pressure is within a healthy range and you do not need medication, you may only need a recheck every two years.” Watch for lows and highs.', 'Sometimes blood pressure medications can reduce your blood pressure too much.', 'If you have signs of low blood

'Peripheral artery disease (puh-rif-er-uhl ahr-tah-ree dih-zeez): A build-up of fat and cholesterol deposits called plaque in arteries in your legs, arms, head or internal organs.', 'This reduces blood flow, causing pain, numbness and a heavy, aching sensation when walking or climbing stairs.', 'Peripheral artery disease can increase the risk for slow-healing infections, too.', 'Treatments include quitting smoking and controlling blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar.', 'Saturated fat: A type of fat found in abundance in butter, whole milk, ice cream, full-fat cheese, fatty meats, poultry skin, and palm and coconut oils.', 'Saturated fat raises levels of heart-threatening LDL cholesterol in your bloodstream.', 'It can also interfere with your body’s ability to absorb blood sugar easily.', 'Limiting saturated fat can help control your risk for heart disease.', 'Sympathetic nervous system: The system that produces the “fight or flight” response and prepares you for stress or an emergency.', 'It’s responsible for readying the body for action: increasing the heart rate, breathing rate and alertness.', 'The body’s parasympathetic nervous system does the opposite.', 'It slows heart and breathing rate, bringing on a sense of relaxation.', 'Systolic (sis-tall-ick) blood pressure: The top, or first, number in a blood pressure reading.', 'Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during a heartbeat.', 'For most people, a healthy systolic blood pressure reading is below 120 mm Hg.', 'Rising systolic blood pressure may indicate that arteries are becoming stiff or that there’s a build-up of plaque.About high blood pressure High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is usually defined as having a sustained blood pressure of 140/90mmHg or above.', 'The line between normal and raised blood pressure is not fixed and depends on your individual circumstances.', 'However, most doctors agree that the ideal blood pressure for a physically healthy person is around 120/80mmHg.', 'A normal blood pressure reading is classed as less than 130/80mmHg.', 'The heart (blood pump) The heart is a muscle that is designed to constantly pump blood around the body.', 'It pumps blood that is low in oxygen towards the lungs, through the venous ‘pipeline’ (veins), where it receives a fresh supply of oxygen.', 'Once the blood is fully oxygenated, the heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood around the body so that the oxygen can be used by the body’s muscles and cells, through the arterial ‘pipeline’ (arteries).', 'How is blood pressure measured?', 'Blood pressure is defined as the amount of pressure that is exerted on the artery walls as blood moves through them.', 'It is measured in millimetres of mercury, or mmHg.', 'A more detailed explanation is provided below.', 'Two measurements are used to measure blood pressure: Systolic pressure – the measure of blood pressure exerted when your heart beats and forces blood around your body.', 'Diastolic pressure – the measure of blood pressure when your heart is resting in between beats.', 'Both the systolic and diastolic pressures are measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg).', 'The figures are usually represented with the systolic pressure first, followed by the diastolic pressure.', 'Therefore, if your GP says that your blood pressure is ‘120 over 80’, or 120/80mmHg, they mean that you have a systolic pressure of 120mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 80mmHg.', 'More about the diagnosis of high blood pressure Symptoms of high blood pressure High blood pressure often causes no symptoms,

inhibitors are more effective as a first-choice medication for treating high blood pressure in white people, whereas calcium channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics, tend to work better for black people.', 'It is thought that this is because black people tend to have a lower level of renin in their blood.', 'Renin is an enzyme that helps to regulate blood pressure.', 'ACE inhibitors are most effective when there is a high amount of renin in the blood, so they are not as effective in treating black people with high blood pressure.', 'Therefore, your GP will consider your ethnic background

blockers\\n\\nThiazide diuretics\\n\\nAlpha-blockers\\n\\nBeta-blockers Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors work by blocking the actions of some of the hormones that help to regulate blood pressure.', 'By stopping these hormones from working, the medication helps to reduce the amount of water in your blood, and it widens your arteries, decreasing your blood pressure.', 'ACE inhibitors are not suitable for: pregnant or breastfeeding women\\n\\npeople with conditions that affect the blood supply to their kidneys ACE inhibitors have been known to reduce the blood supply to the kidneys, which can reduce their efficiency.', 'Therefore, blood and urine tests may be carried out before you start taking ACE inhibitors to make sure that there are no pre-existing problems with your kidneys.', 'You may need to have annual blood and urine tests if you continue to use ACE inhibitors.', 'Side effects of ACE inhibitors include: dizziness\\n\\ntiredness or weakness\\n\\nheadaches\\n\\na persistent dry cough Most of these side effects should pass in a few days, although some people find that they continue to have a dry cough.', 'If side effects become particularly troublesome, a medication that works in a similar way to ACE inhibitors, known as an angiotensin-2 receptor antagonist, may be recommended.', 'ACE

Alpha-blockers are effective in reducing high blood pressure.', 'However, they are not usually prescribed unless you are already taking other medication and your blood pressure is still high.', 'Alpha-blockers, work by preventing the muscles that line your blood vessels (alpha receptors) from being activated and tightening the muscles in the walls of your blood vessels.', 'This enables the blood vessels to relax and open, making it much easier for blood to flow through them and lower your blood pressure.', 'Examples of alpha-blockers include: Tolazoline\\n\\nDoxasosin\\n\\nTrazodone Common side effects of alpha-blockers include: fainting spells when you first start the treatment\\n\\ndizziness\\n\\nheadache\\n\\nswollen ankles\\n\\ntiredness Beta-blockers Beta-blockers used to be a popular treatment for high blood pressure, but now they only tend to be used when other treatments have not proved successful.', 'This is because beta-blockers have more potential side effects than

your GP or pharmacist before taking any ‘over the counter’ medication in combination with those prescribed for you Do not suddenly stop taking beta-blockers without first consulting your GP.', 'Stopping this medication suddenly will lead to serious side effects, such as a rise in blood pressure or chest pain caused by reduction in oxygen to your heart muscle (angina).', 'Complications of high blood pressure If left untreated, high blood pressure can cause many different types of cardiovascular disease.', 'For example: stroke – a serious condition where the blood supply to the brain is interrupted\\n\\nheart attack – a serious condition where the blood supply to part of the heart blocked\\n\\nblood clot (thrombosis) – a serious condition that is caused by blood clots within the blood vessels\\n\\naneurysm – a serious condition that is caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall, which forms a bulge in the blood vessel Kidney disease High blood pressure can damage the small

conditions that can cause secondary hypertension are\\n\\nProblems with the parathyroid gland.', 'Acromegaly, which is a condition where the pituitary gland makes too much growth hormone.', 'Tumors in the adrenal or pituitary glands.', 'Reactions to medicines for other medical problems.', 'Pregnancy.', 'What are the symptoms of high blood pressure?', 'Most people who have high blood pressure do not have symptoms.', 'In some cases, people with high blood pressure may have a pounding feeling in their head or chest, a feeling of lightheadedness or dizziness, or other signs.', 'Without symptoms, people with high blood pressure may go years without knowing they have the condition.', 'How is high blood pressure diagnosed?', 'A visit to your doctor is the only way to find out if you have high blood pressure.', 'You should have a general medical check-up that includes a review of your family’s medical history.', 'Your doctor will take several blood pressure readings using a device called a sphygmomanometer and run a few routine tests.', 'Your doctor may also use a device called an ophthalmoscope to look at the blood vessels in your eyes.', 'Doctors can see if these vessels have thickened, narrowed, or burst, which may be a sign of high blood pressure.', 'Your doctor will also use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and the sound of blood flowing through your arteries.', 'In some cases, a chest x-ray and electrocardiogram may be needed.', 'Blood pressure readings\\n\\nBlood pressure readings measure the two parts of blood pressure: systolic and diastolic pressures.', 'Systolic pressure is the force of blood flow through an artery when the heart beats.', 'Diastolic pressure is the force of blood flow within blood vessels when the heart rests between beats.', 'A blood pressure reading measures both the systolic and diastolic forces, with the systolic pressure listed first.', 'The numbers show your pressure in units of millimeters of mercury (mm Hg)—how high the pressure inside your arteries would be able to raise a column of mercury.', 'For example, a reading of 120/80 mm Hg means a systolic pressure of 120 mm Hg and diastolic pressure of 80 mm Hg.', 'Most doctors do not make a final diagnosis of high blood pressure until they measure your blood pressure several times (at least 2 blood pressure readings on 3 different days).', 'Some doctors ask their patients to wear a portable machine that measures their blood pressure over the course of several days.', 'This machine may help the doctor find out whether a patient has true high blood pressure or what is known as “white-coat hypertension.” White-coat hypertension is a condition in which a patient’s blood pressure rises during a visit to a doctor when anxiety and stress probably play a role.', 'How often should blood pressure be checked?', 'Adults should have their blood pressure checked at least once a year.', 'Many grocery or drug stores have blood pressure machines that you can use for free any time you visit the stores.', 'Keep in mind, though, that these machines may not give you a correct reading.', 'Blood pressure monitors for use at home can be bought at drug stores, department stores, and other places.', 'Again, these monitors may not always give you a correct reading.', 'You should always compare your machine’s reading with a reading from your doctor’s machine to make sure they are the same.', 'Remember that any measurement above normal should prompt a visit to the doctor, who can then talk with you about the best course of action.', 'How high is high?', 'According to guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC), a reading below 120/80 mm Hg is classified as normal blood pressure.', 'Those with a blood pressure reading anywhere from 120/80 up to 129/80 are classified within a category called elevated blood pressure.', 'Hypertension is defined as a reading of 130/80 or higher.', 'The classification chart is based on adults, aged 18 and older, who are not taking high blood pressure medicines and who are not acutely ill.', 'If systolic and diastolic measurements fall into different categories, the higher category should be used to classify the person’s blood pressure status.', 'How is high blood pressure treated?', 'The first course of action involves lifestyle changes, especially for people with elevated blood pressure.', 'Start eating a low-fat and low-salt diet.', 'Lose weight, if you need to.', 'Begin a regular exercise program.', 'Learn to manage stress.', 'If you smoke, quit.', 'Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all.', 'Remember that moderate intake is an average of one or two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women.', 'Control obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), if you have it.', 'Many patients who get their OSA under control see improvements in their blood pressure.', 'Medicines are available if these changes do not help control your blood pressure within 3 to 6 months.', 'Diuretics help rid your body of water and sodium.', 'ACE inhibitors block the enzyme that raises your blood pressure.', 'Other types of medicines— beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and other vasodilators—work in different ways, but their overall effect is to help relax and widen your blood vessels and reduce the pressure inside the vessel.']\n"

            "\n",
            "High blood pressure often doesn't have any symptoms, so you usually don't feel it. For that reason, hypertension is usually diagnosed by a health care professional during a routine checkup. If you have a close relative with hypertension, or other risk factors, it is especially important to pay attention to your blood pressure reading.\n",
            "\n",
            "In order to diagnose high blood pressure, your doctor will check your blood pressure with a blood pressure cuff. It's important to pay attention to both the higher (systolic) and the lower (diastolic) numbers in your blood pressure readings.\n",
            "\n",
            "If your blood pressure is extremely high, you may have unusually strong headaches, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or poor exercise tolerance. If you have any of these symptoms, seek an evaluation promptly.What is high blood pressure ?\n",
            "\n",
            "Blood pressures differ between individuals. Some people have low, some average and some high blood pressure levels.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are various definitions of high blood pressure, which is also known as hypertension, but most doctors consider blood pressures of 140/90 and greater to be high.\n",
            "\n",
            "The precise values that doctors might interpret as high blood pressure depend to an extent on individual circumstances. For example, in patients with diabetes, the definition of hypertension is considered by some to be pressures greater than 130/80.\n",
            "\n",
            "The definition of hypertension is used by doctors to help decide which patients would benefit from medical (lifestyle and drug) treatment to lower pressure.\n",
            "\n",
            "The definitions depend on the balance of risk of not lowering blood pressure (heart attack and stroke, etc) versus the risks of treatment (drug side effects, etc).\n",
            "\n",
            "This explains why hypertension is defined at lower blood pressure levels in diabetic subjects. For the same blood pressure, cardiovascular complications (that is damage to the heart, blood vessels and brain) are more likely in diabetics and blood pressure reduction offers benefit even when a diabetic’s blood pressure is not as high as regular definitions of hypertension.Get answers to the most frequently asked questions about hypertension from nephrologist Leslie Thomas, M.D.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hi. I'm Dr. Leslie Thomas, a nephrologist at Mayo Clinic. And I'm here to answer some of the important questions you might have about hypertension.\n",
            "\n",
            "Measuring your blood pressure at home is a straightforward process. Many people have a slightly higher blood pressure in one arm versus the other. So it's important to measure the blood pressures in the arm with the higher readings. It's best to avoid caffeine, exercise and, if you smoke, smoking for at least 30 minutes. To prepare for the measurement, you should be relaxed with your feet on the floor and legs uncrossed, and your back supported for at least five minutes. Your arms should be supported on a flat surface. After resting for five minutes, at least two readings are taken one minute apart in the morning prior to medications and in the evening before the evening meal. Your blood pressure monitor should be checked for proper calibration every year.\n",
            "\n",
            "This pattern of abrupt changes in blood pressure from normal to quite high is sometimes referred to as labile blood pressure. For those who develop labile blood pressure, heart problems, hormonal problems, neurological problems, or even psychological conditions might be present. Finding and treating the underlying cause of labile blood pressure can significantly improve the condition.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's important to note that some people with high blood pressure already consume a diet significantly restricted in sodium. And those people further restriction of dietary sodium would not necessarily be helpful or even recommended. In many people, dietary sodium intake is though relatively high. Therefore, an effective target to consider for those people is less than 1500 milligrams per day. Many though, will benefit from a target of less than a 1000 milligrams per day. Following dietary sodium restriction, it may take some time, even weeks, for the blood pressure to improve and stabilize at a lower range. So it is critically important to both be consistent with decreased sodium intake and patient when assessing for improvement.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is a very common question. A lot of people want to avoid medication if they can, when trying to reduce their blood pressure. A few ways have been shown scientifically to reduce blood pressure. The first, and perhaps most important, is to stay physically active. Losing weight also can be important in a lot of different people. Limiting alcohol, reducing sodium intake, and increasing dietary potassium intake can all help.\n",
            "\n",
            "There's not one best medication for the treatment of hypertension for everyone. Because an individual's historical and present medical conditions must be considered. Additionally, every person has a unique physiology. Assessing how certain physiological forces may be present to contribute to the hypertension in an individual allows for a rational approach to medication choice. Antihypertensive medications are grouped by class. Each class of medication differs from the other classes by the way it lowers blood pressure. For instance, diuretics, no matter the type, act to reduce the body's total content of salt and water. This leads to reduction in plasma volume within the blood vessels and consequently a lower blood pressure. Calcium channel blockers reduce the relative constriction of blood vessels. This reduced vasoconstriction also promotes a lower blood pressure. Other classes of antihypertensive medication act in their own ways. Considering your health conditions, physiology, and how each medication works, your doctor can advise the safest and most effective medication for you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Following the correction of blood pressure or the institution of certain blood pressure medications, it's pretty common to see changes in the markers for kidney function on blood tests. However, small changes in these markers, which reflects small changes in kidney filtration performance shouldn't necessarily be interpreted as absolute evidence of kidney harm. Your doctor can interpret changes in laboratory tests following any change in medication.\n",
            "\n",
            "Keep an open dialogue with your medical team about your goals and personal preferences. Communication, trust and collaboration are key to long-term success managing your blood pressure. Never hesitate to ask your medical team any questions or concerns you have. Being informed makes all the difference.

When undetected for an extended period and untreated, the condition can become increasingly dangerous — possibly even fatal. On the other hand, the life expectancy of someone with controlled high blood pressure can often be well into retirement age. With that being said, research³ does show that although you can live a long life, it may be five to seven years shorter than those without high blood pressure. Some potential causes⁴ of this shorter life expectancy include smoking and obesity. First, if you're a smoker, you are looking at a potential decrease in life expectancy (LE) due to not only conditions associated with smoking but elevated hypertension brought on by smoking. Likewise, obesity can increase blood pressure (blood pressure) to dangerous levels, which can lead to a shorter LE. There is also an increase in the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke among both men and women with hypertension, all of which could be dangerous and even fatal if not properly treated.\n",

One study⁵ notes that obesity increases the concentration of norepinephrine, a stress hormone, which raises blood pressure. Extra fat tissue affects the kidneys by increasing salt and fluid retention, which also leads to high blood pressure. Diets high in sodium and low in nutrients Many studies have been done on the association between high dietary sodium intake and hypertension. One study⁶ reported that high sodium is linked to hypertension, morbidity, and mortality from cardiovascular diseases. Restricting your sodium if you have hypertension has been shown⁷ to lower blood pressure effectively. On the other hand, another study⁸ found that participants who consumed four or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day had a lower risk of being diagnosed with hypertension. Age Another risk factor for developing hypertension is being 65 or older. In fact, research⁹ has revealed that more than 7,000,000 premature deaths and 4.5% of the global disease burden had resulted from hypertension, with the elderly being affected at a higher rate. The report included a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey that compared the high percentage of hypertension cases among the elderly at 70% versus the much lower 32% for those between 40 and 59 years old. Smoking Smokers are also at a higher risk of developing hypertension than non-smokers. One study¹⁰ revealed that not only does smoking take years off your life expectancy and decrease your quality of life, but the life-course impact of smoking also increases your risk of hypertension, respiratory conditions, and myocardial infarction. Smoking is strongly associated¹¹ with increased heart rate and blood pressure. The journal also reported a link to malignant hypertension, which refers to dangerously high blood pressure that comes on quickly and seemingly out of nowhere. Malignant hypertension can be fatal if not treated right away, so speak with your doctor if you have any concerns. With timely treatment, you can control the condition. Health conditions It's also common for some people to have high blood pressure due to other health conditions. At least one in 20¹² high blood pressure cases is caused by either an underlying health condition or a medication. Medical conditions often linked to high blood pressure include lupus, obstructive sleep apnea, kidney disease and kidney infections, diabetes, and an overactive thyroid.\n",

            "What are the symptoms of high blood pressure? Hypertension is commonly referred to as the 'silent killer.' The reason is that there are often no signs or symptoms associated with high blood pressure. The only way to know whether you have high blood pressure is to check it. Your doctor will be able to identify whether there's an issue with your blood and how to treat it properly.\n",

            "What should you know about your high blood pressure as you age? High blood pressure can result from aging because, as we get older, it's common for our arteries to stiffen, which raises blood pressure — even among exceptionally healthy individuals. Not having developed hypertension by the time you reach your forties or fifties does not guarantee you will never get it. High blood pressure is very prevalent, especially as you age. Here is some additional information to know about your high blood pressure as you age: High blood pressure guidelines were updated in 2017 11 health organizations — including the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology — came together in 2017¹³ to change blood pressure guidelines. This means that while a blood pressure of 130/80mm Hg was once not considered elevated, it is now. The guidelines are divided into five blood pressure levels: Normal — <120/<80mm Hg Elevated — 120-129/<80mm Hg Stage 1 High Blood Pressure or Hypertension — 130-139 or 80-89mm Hg Stage 2 High Blood Pressure or Hypertension — 140+ or 90+mm Hg Hypertension Crisis (extremely concerning, consult your doctor immediately) — 180+ and/or >120mm Hg High blood pressure numbers vary by age While a general adult average of <120/<80mm HG is recommended, you should note that those numbers vary depending on multiple factors. Current health conditions and genetics affect the average healthy blood pressure, and age can play an important role. For a little more insight, the following is an example of normal blood pressure by age (assuming no other factors play a role). Males by age: 21 to 25 — 120.5/78. 5\n",

For example, a blood pressure reading is written as 120/80 mmHg, or 120 over 80. The systolic pressure is 120 and the diastolic pressure is 80.\", \"The Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure has classified blood pressure measurements into several categories: Normal blood pressure is systolic pressure less than 120 and diastolic pressure less than 80. Elevated is systolic pressure of 120-129 and diastolic pressure less than 80. Stage 1 hypertension is systolic pressure of 130-139 or diastolic pressure of 80-89. Stage 2 hypertension is systolic pressure of 140 or greater or diastolic pressure of 90 or greater.\", \"Several potentially serious health conditions are linked to high blood pressure, including: Atherosclerosis: a disease of the arteries caused by a buildup of plaque, or fatty material, on the inside walls of the blood vessels; hypertension contributes to this buildup by putting added stress and force on the artery walls.Heart Disease: Heart failure (the heart is not strong enough to pump blood adequately), ischemic heart disease (the heart tissue doesn't get enough blood and oxygen), and hypertensive cardiomyopathy (thickened, abnormally functioning heart muscle) are all associated with high blood pressure.Kidney Disease: Hypertension can damage the blood vessels and filters in the kidneys, so that the kidneys cannot excrete waste properly. Kidney disease can also cause high blood pressure, when electrolytes (including sodium) cannot be adequately secreted from the body.Stroke: Hypertension can lead to stroke, either by contributing to the process of atherosclerosis (which can lead to blockages and/or clots), or by weakening the blood vessel wall and causing it to rupture.Eye Disease: Hypertension can damage the very small blood vessels in the retina.\", \" High blood pressure often doesn't have any symptoms, so you usually don't feel it. For that reason, hypertension is usually diagnosed by a health care professional during a routine checkup. If you have a close relative with hypertension, or other risk factors, it is especially important to pay attention to your blood pressure reading. In order to diagnose high blood pressure, your doctor will check your blood pressure with a blood pressure cuff. It's important to pay attention to both the higher (systolic) and the lower (diastolic) numbers in your blood pressure readings. If your blood pressure is extremely high, you may have unusually strong headaches, chest pain, difficulty breathing, or poor exercise tolerance. If you have any of these symptoms, seek an evaluation promptly.\", \"Lifestyle changes are key to keeping normal blood pressure. In fact, most doctors will suggest them before prescribing drugs. Lifestyle changes are also the recommended treatment for elevated blood pressure, a condition in which blood pressure readings are higher than 120 (systolic) over 80 (diastolic) and regularly over 130/80. Quit smoking. This might be the most important step you can take to improve health. Lose weight. Keeping a healthy weight can help lower your blood pressure. If you're overweight, work with your doctor to design a safe weight loss plan to get closer to your ideal weight. Eat a healthy diet, such as the DASH diet, which is high in fruits, vegetables, lean protein and whole grains and low in salt and fat. Also make sure you get enough vitamins and minerals. Some studies show that having the recommended daily amounts of vitamin C, vitamin E, potassium, magnesium, and calcium can improve heart health. There is no real evidence regarding the benefits of multivitamins. Getting your vitamins through your food is a better alternative. Lower the amount of salt in your diet. Exercise. Regular aerobic activity, such as brisk walking on most days of the week, can lower blood pressure. Regularity of exercise is as important as intensity. Limit alcohol. If you drink, women should drink no more than one alcoholic drink per day; men should limit intake to two drinks. \\\"One drink\\\" means 5 ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor.Reduce stress. Emotional factors play a role in blood pressure. Studies show that relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga, or therapy may reduce blood pressure.\",\" As is true with any medication, high blood pressure drugs have side effects. Among the most common are the following:Diuretics: headache, weakness, low potassium blood levels ACE inhibitors: dry and persistent cough, headache, diarrhea, high potassium blood levelsAngiotensin receptor blockers: fatigue, dizziness or fainting, diarrhea, congestion, high potassium blood levelsCalcium channel blockers: dizziness, heart rhythm problems, ankle swelling, constipationBeta-blockers: dizziness or lightheadedness, decreased sexual ability, drowsiness, fatigue, low heart rate Alpha-blockers: dizziness, headache, pounding heartbeat, nausea, weakness, weight gain\", \"A healthy diet, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, is effective in helping to lower high blood pressure. The DASH diet calls for a certain number of daily servings from various food groups, including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.The following steps can also help:Eating more fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foodsEating less of foods that are high in saturated fat and cholesterol, such as fried foodsEating more whole grain products, fish, poultry, and nutsEating less red meat and sweetsEating foods that are high in magnesium, potassium, and calciumEating foods with less sodium.\",        \"If you are diagnosed with high blood pressure, it's important to see your doctor on a regular basis.

For example, in patients with diabetes, the definition of hypertension is considered by some to be pressures greater than 130/80.\",\"The definition of hypertension is used by doctors to help decide which patients would benefit from medical (lifestyle and drug) treatment to lower pressure.The definitions depend on the balance of risk of not lowering blood pressure (heart attack and stroke, etc) versus the risks of treatment (drug side effects, etc).This explains why hypertension is defined at lower blood pressure levels in diabetic subjects. For the same blood pressure, cardiovascular complications (that is damage to the heart, blood vessels and brain) are more likely in diabetics and blood pressure reduction offers benefit even when a diabetic’s blood pressure is not as high as regular definitions of hypertension.\",\n",

These include hormonal imbalances and kidney diseases that can result from genetic problems, occasionally tumours (usually benign) and blood vessel narrowing. Doctors are trained to look for signs of these specific conditions, as they are often curable.\",\"High blood pressure is more common is older age groups and in people with a family history of hypertension. It is also more frequent in those who are overweight. However, high blood pressure can affect young thin people with no family history, so no one should consider himself or herself immune from high blood pressure.\",\"It is the goal of good clinical practice to reduce high levels of pressure wherever possible in order to reduce the risk of complications such as heart attack and stroke.Changes to lifestyle such as weight loss, reduced salt intake, reduced alcohol consumption or exercise are often the first line of treatment.

To prepare for the measurement, you should be relaxed with your feet on the floor and legs uncrossed, and your back supported for at least five minutes. Your arms should be supported on a flat surface.

Additionally, every person has a unique physiology. Assessing how certain physiological forces may be present to contribute to the hypertension in an individual allows for a rational approach to medication choice. Antihypertensive medications are grouped by class. Each class of medication differs from the other classes by the way it lowers blood pressure. For instance, diuretics, no matter the type, act to reduce the body's total content of salt and water. This leads to reduction in plasma volume within the blood vessels and consequently a lower blood pressure. Calcium channel blockers reduce the relative constriction of blood vessels. This reduced vasoconstriction also promotes a lower blood pressure. Other classes of antihypertensive medication act in their own ways. Considering your health conditions, physiology, and how each medication works, your doctor can advise the safest and most effective medication for you.\",\n",
