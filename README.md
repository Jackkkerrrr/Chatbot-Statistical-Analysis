# Chatbot Statistical Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of chatbot interactions. Utilizing a dataset of chatbot conversations, we aim to uncover patterns, user behaviors, and insights to enhance chatbot performance and user satisfaction.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and preparing the data for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing data to understand central tendencies and dispersions.
- **Visualization**: Employing various plots to illustrate data distributions and relationships.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assessing user sentiments to gauge satisfaction levels.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identifying common topics and intents from user inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for combining code execution with rich text.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing.
